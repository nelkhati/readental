        How can you create your dental school list when applying?

    <ol type = "1">
        <font color = "008080">
        <li>
            I applied to 19 schools and received interviews to 3 of them
        </li>
        <li>
            Some schools have higher stats than others, yet what was surprising is getting interviews
            from schools with higher stats. Hence, it depends on what the schools are really looking for
        </li>
        <li>
            I did not buy the ADEA official guide to dental schools and I could not burrow it from anyone
            as I was not in the US. Hence, I searched every school individually and wrote down their
            stats
        </li>
        <li>
            My goal was to become a dentist in the US no matter what State they are in. So I applied to
            every possible school that would accept internationals, that did not care about my religion
            and that did not require Anatomy as it was not offered in CMU Qatar
        </li>
        <li>
            An important thing to consider is that every school first looks at its residents, then non-
            residents, and then internationals
        </li>
        <li>
            Apply to schools that you are competitive for, apply for schools that you can afford, and
            apply to some dream schools that if you got in, it would be amazing but you do not expect to go there

        <li>
            I have been working as a Research Assistant at CMUQ since my graduation (May) to pay back my Financial Aid and gain more 
            experience in the lab while working on my Honors Thesis project
        </li>
        <li>
            My PI was very flexible, he allowed me to take a few weeks off when I needed to travel twice to the US for my 3 interviews 
            (September- December)
        </li>
        <li>
            I started developing a Dental-related website, readental.me and currently working on writing about my experiences that have 
            led me to where I am today to help other international students with similar interests
        </li>
        <li>
            Always make sure that you are productive that you can talk about during your interviews and try to develop certain 
            skills that you wouldn’t have otherwise
        </li>
        <li>
            Joined a 48hr competition at CMUQ with my friends and won an iPad Pro
        </li>
        <li>
            Shadowing a dentist after work (6pm-9pm)

        <li>
            HAVE FUN because I know I may not when school starts!
        </li>
        <li>
            Also, I am planning on visiting my home country before going to the US in the summer. So
            that’s exciting!

            How and where did I travel to my Dental School interviews?
        </font>
        </p>
        <ol type = "1">
            <li>
            I was extremely lucky to have a supportive father who was willing to pay for all my traveling expenses without any hesitation
            </li>
            <li>
            I took about 2-3 months to prepare myself for any interview that would come up
            </li>
            <li>
            I took a lot of notes whether it is about the dental field, interview tips, questions to ask schools, Professors and even students
            </li>
            <li>
            I also wrote down questions like “Why dentistry, tell me about yourself, why do you want to join this school, what are your 
            weaknesses and strengths”
            </li>
            <li>
            I tried to answer these questions over the 2 months period and tried to give different stories or examples
            </li>
            <li>
            At the end, I tried to shorten my answers to make them concise and to have a brief idea of what I want to talk about. 
            BUT DO NOT MEMORIZE ANSWERS! Always be yourself
            </li>
            <li>
            I practiced with friends, family, career advisor, talked to myself in the mirror and even on the airplanes and with my Uber 
            drivers (who eventually became my friends)
            </li>
            <li>
            For my first interview at Maryland, I travelled from Qatar with a checked-in bag and arrived ~3 nights before my interview to 
            avoid jet lag during the interview day. I also planned to stay at Virginia for 2 weeks in case I got any interviews around that time. 
            So I left Maryland the morning after my interview
            </li>
            <li>
            Luckily, I was able to change the date of an interview at Colorado. So I booked for my flights and hotel and traveled after 3 days 
            of reaching to Virginia. I travelled with just a handbag and stayed for just 1 night, then flew back to Virginia the night of my 
            interview day to my sister before flying to Qatar
            </li>
            <li>
            I took my travel handbag with my to the University. They were nice enough to provide a place to off my luggage
            </li>
            <li>
            I received my acceptance to Maryland ~Dec. 3rd and 2 days later I received my third interview invitation at Tufts
            </li>
            <li>
            It was extremely difficult weighing out the advantages and disadvantages of each university and whether or not it would be worth 
            paying so much money for a flight to the US within 4 days and finding a hotel around campus, not knowing how it will end up and 
            whether or not I will be accepted into Tufts, considering that it was quite competitive and an extremely expensive University
            </li>
            <li>
            I traveled to Boston with just a handbag ~2 nights before my interview and flew back the morning after my interview day
            </li>
            <li>
            It was quite cold in Boston, so I brought a coat which I took off and kept into a room as soon as I entered the building
            </li>
            <li>
            I carried my bag which had my passport and IDs as well as gum, lipstick, perfume, floss, toothpaste and a toothbrush as you may 
            need them after lunch
            </li>
            <li>
            I also carried my brown Portfolio which had a card with my email and contact information just in case the interviewer asked me 
            for it. It also had a copy of my website, my CV, a pen and a notepad to take notes during the presentations given before the interview
            </li>
            <li>
            Some schools may give you pens, notepads and booklets about their university which can sometimes be useful to read to be able to 
            answer the “Why us?”. However, I do recommend doing your own research before the interview day to avoid stress. You can look at them 
            after your interview when you get to choose between different universities
            </li>
            <li>
            For transportations, I used Uber as I was new to all these places and did not know anyone living there
            </li>
            <li>
            The days before the interview I try to walk around the city, destress, think about the reasons why I would love to spend the 
            next 4 years of my life there and check out places or cafes to work at and review my notes
            </li>
            <li>
            I also tried to have fun and pretend like it was just a trip for entertainment and exploration
            </li>

            If your GPA is not as high as the University’s average GPA, then always aim for high DAT
            scores (20+). However, do not be discouraged if either of them are average or even below
            average

            My GPA was average and so was my my DAT score, a 19

            <li>
            People told me to re-take the DAT, however, I had to ensure I was completely ready to retake it and score higher. Because, as an International student,
            I had to think about the costs of booking another flight to the US, living expenses and hotel bookings
            </li>
            <li>
            In such cases, focus on what makes you unique and what your strengths are if they are not
