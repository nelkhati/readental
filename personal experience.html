        I talked to some of my Professors and friends about pursuing dentistry. Some students said who would ever leave research and lab to 
        check people’s mouths. While most Professors said, they only accept 1-2% International students in a class of 100-200 students. 
        International students include Canadians. So what makes you think you will get in and not any of the 2500 applicants? 
        And that is the most important question you should be answering.

        Where you select all the schools you would like to apply to. This takes a very long time, as you will need to 
        look at their tuition fees, acceptance rates and most importantly, their prerequisites. Make sure to save some time to answer 
        supplemental questions asked by some schools. If you are not sure which schools to apply to, you may purchase the ADEA official 
        guide to dental school book (~$50). Also, if you are an international, you should also check if they have any seats for 
        internationals, because not all schools offer that

            I applied to 19 schools and received interviews to 3 of them

        <li>
            Some schools have higher stats than others, yet what was surprising is getting interviews
            from schools with higher stats. Hence, it depends on what the schools are really looking for
        </li>
        <li>
            I did not buy the ADEA official guide to dental schools and I could not burrow it from anyone

            stats

        <li>
            My goal was to become a dentist in the US no matter what State they are in. So I applied to

            and that did not require Anatomy as it was not offered in CMU Qatar
        </li>
        <li>
            An important thing to consider is that every school first looks at its residents, then non-
            residents, and then internationals

        <li>
            Apply to schools that you are competitive for, apply for schools that you can afford, and

            Luckily, I was able to change the date of an interview at Colorado. So I booked for my flights and hotel and traveled after 3 days 
            of reaching to Virginia. I travelled with just a handbag and stayed for just 1 night, then flew back to Virginia the night of my 
            interview day to my sister before flying to Qatar
            </li>
            <li>
            I took my travel handbag with my to the University. They were nice enough to provide a place to off my luggage
            </li>
            <li>
            I received my acceptance to Maryland ~Dec. 3rd and 2 days later I received my third interview invitation at Tufts
            </li>
            <li>
            It was extremely difficult weighing out the advantages and disadvantages of each university and whether or not it would be worth 
            paying so much money for a flight to the US within 4 days and finding a hotel around campus, not knowing how it will end up and 
            whether or not I will be accepted into Tufts, considering that it was quite competitive and an extremely expensive University
            </li>
            <li>
            I traveled to Boston with just a handbag ~2 nights before my interview and flew back the morning after my interview day
            </li>
            <li>
            It was quite cold in Boston, so I brought a coat which I took off and kept into a room as soon as I entered the building
            </li>
            <li>
            I carried my bag which had my passport and IDs as well as gum, lipstick, perfume, floss, toothpaste and a toothbrush as you may 
            need them after lunch
            </li>
            <li>
            I also carried my brown Portfolio which had a card with my email and contact information just in case the interviewer asked me 
            for it. It also had a copy of my website, my CV, a pen and a notepad to take notes during the presentations given before the interview
            </li>
            <li>
            Some schools may give you pens, notepads and booklets about their university which can sometimes be useful to read to be able to 
            answer the “Why us?”. However, I do recommend doing your own research before the interview day to avoid stress. You can look at them 
            after your interview when you get to choose between different universities
            </li>
            <li>
            For transportations, I used Uber as I was new to all these places and did not know anyone living there
            </li>
            <li>
            The days before the interview I try to walk around the city, destress, think about the reasons why I would love to spend the 
            next 4 years of my life there and check out places or cafes to work at and review my notes
            </li>
            <li>
            I also tried to have fun and pretend like it was just a trip for entertainment and exploration
            </li>

            <li>
            Show them you are continuously learning, growing and seeking new knowledge, rather than

            If your GPA is not as high as the University’s average GPA, then always aim for high DAT
            scores (20+). However, do not be discouraged if either of them are average or even below
            average
            </li>
            <li>
            My GPA was average and so was my my DAT score, a 19
            </li>
            <li>
            People told me to re-take the DAT, however, I had to ensure I was completely ready to retake it and score higher. Because, as an International student,
            I had to think about the costs of booking another flight to the US, living expenses and hotel bookings
            </li>
            <li>
            In such cases, focus on what makes you unique and what your strengths are if they are not
            grades
