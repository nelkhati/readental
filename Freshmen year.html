        It was challenging, should I start Dental school immediately after highschool or risking the next 4 years taking Biological Sciences. I talked to some of my Professors and friends seeking advice about pursuing dentistry. I got what I least expected. Some students asked, "Who would ever leave research and lab to 
        check peopleâ€™s mouths?"". While most Professors said: "Dental schools in the US only accept 1-2% International students in a class of 100-200 students, can you find an alternative?". Little did I know. It was the most challenging journey I could have ever imagined going through, yet most rewarding.
        International students include Canadians. So what makes you think you will get in and not any of the 2500 applicants? 
        And that is the most important question you should be answering.
