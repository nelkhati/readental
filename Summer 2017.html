        Applied and worked at the Ihab Younis Lab for Qatar Student Initiated Undergraduate Research Program (QSIURP) from June to August 2017

        </li>
        <li>
        Talked to an academic advisor from the main campus in May. Unfortunately, he informed me that there is a 0% chance of me getting any interviews because of my late application.
         Applications open June 1st and schools review them as soon as they are complete
        </li>
        <li>
        Talked to my previous academic advisor, Dr. Ken Hovis and asked for any contacts with
        students who have applied to dental schools at the main campus of CMU
        </li>
        <li>
        He sent me contact information of two students CMU graduates who got accepted into Dentistal schools
        </li>
        <li>
        One of whome adviced me to not apply. The second one arranged a Skyped call with me. She helped me with every single thing in the 
        application, from how to schedule and study for my DAT exam, book for it to writing personal statements and
        what universities I should apply to
        </li>
        <li>
        I immediately bought the DAT Bootcamp 3 month subscription plan

        If you are a US citizen taking the exam for the first time and you come from a family of

        Where you select all the schools you would like to apply to. This takes a very long time, as you will need to 
        look at their tuition fees, acceptance rates and most importantly, their prerequisites. Make sure to save some time to answer 
        supplemental questions asked by some schools. If you are not sure which schools to apply to, you may purchase the ADEA official 
        guide to dental school book (~$50). Also, if you are an international, you should also check if they have any seats for 
        internationals, because not all schools offer that
